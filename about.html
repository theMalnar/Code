            <h1>About Gregory</h1>

            <p class=aout-p>
                I've spent much of my professional career in fine dining kitchens. With this I've acquired a unique
                skillset that
                allows me to thrive under intense pressure while following recipes to the T, the ability to execute
                improvisational solutions to unforseen
                problems, and also communicate effectively, clearly, and meaningful to the entire team. These skills are
                what I bring with me in every job
                I take on, be it digital marketing, email campaign marketing, SEO analysis, graphic design, UI/UX design
                and research, or front end development.
                The ability to follow instructions, problemsolve (troubleshoot and debug), improvise (self-research),
                and communicate are what make me a great contender.

                <br>

                Currently I am freelancing for a Terpene Formulation Company and a Loan Brokerage company, doing graphic
                design and email marketing for both. I've also started my own
                business in reverse-wholseale that taps into the immensity of the Amazon market place. I seek to make
                Amazon and Email Marketing my primary sources of income, so that I can learn
                to design and code in leisure, and to pick the projects I want because they're meaningful to me, not
                because I need a job.
